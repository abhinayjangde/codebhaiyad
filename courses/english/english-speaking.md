## Building Blocks of Sentence
<details>
<summary>
Subject
</summary>
Subject<br>
The subject is the person, place, thing, or idea that performs the action or is being described in a sentence. In Hindi, इसे हम "विषय" कहते हैं। यह वह होता है जो वाक्य में क्रिया (action) करता है या उसके बारे में बात होती है।
<br>
<br>
- Example in English: Abhinay reads a book.<br>
- Subject (विषय): Abhinay (क्योंकि Abhinay वह है जो कुछ कर रहा है यानी पढ़ाई कर रहा है।)
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Verb 
</summary>
Verb <br>
The verb is the action word in a sentence. It tells us what the subject is doing. In Hindi, इसे हम "क्रिया" कहते हैं। यह बताता है कि subject क्या कर रहा है या उसका state क्या है।
<br>
<br>
- Example in English: Abhinay reads a book.<br>
- Verb (क्रिया): reads (क्योंकि यह बताता है कि Abhinay क्या कर रहा है, यानी पढ़ाई कर रहा है।)
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Object
</summary>
Object <br>
The object is the thing or person that is affected by the action of the verb. It usually comes after the verb. In Hindi, इसे हम "वस्तु" या "कारक" कहते हैं। यह वह चीज़ होती है जिस पर क्रिया का असर होता है।
<br>
<br>
- Example in English: Abhinay reads a book.<br>
- Object (वस्तु): a book (क्योंकि पढ़ाई का असर book पर हो रहा है, यानी Abhinay book पढ़ रहा है।)

**The Stork and The Crab**
<details>
<summary>
Story<br>
</summary>
Once upon a time, there lived a stork who used to pick fishes from the pond beside him and eat them. However, as he grew older, he found it difficult to catch a single fish. In order to feed himself, he thought of a plan. He told the fish, frogs, and crabs that some men are planning to fill the pond and grow crops, and that's why there won't be any fish in the pond. He also told them how sad he felt about this and that he will miss them all. The fish were sad and asked the stork to help them. The stork promised to take all of them to a bigger pond. However, he told them, "As I am old, I can take only a few of you at one go." The stork would take the fishes to a rock, kill them, and eat them up. Every time he was hungry, he would take a few of them to the rock and eat them. There lived a crab in the pond, who wanted to go to the bigger pond too. The stork thought of eating the crab for a change and agreed on helping him. On the way, the crab asked the stork, 'Where is the big pond?' The stork laughed and pointed to the rock, which was filled with fish bones. The crab realised that the stork would kill him, and so quickly thought of a plan to save himself. He caught the stork's neck and did not let it go until the stork died. The crab was happy that he saved himself and the other fishes from the stork.
